# ExpressJS - Step 03 - JSON beers

## Getting the beers files

Now we need to copy the beers folder from the root of this tutorial into the app folder, as express will look for them there.

When done, you can proceed.

## Reading beer list from JSON file

With node you read a JSON file simply by using `require`:

    var myData = require('./data.json');

We are going to use this technique to get the beer list info needed in the `/beers` route:

    var beerList = require('./beers/beers.json');
    console.log("Beers", beerList)

    var server = app.listen(3000, function () {
      var host = server.address().address;
      var port = server.address().port;
      console.log('Listening at http://%s:%s', host, port);
    });


So we have a `beerList` variable that contains the info needed for the `/beers` route.
Now we can modify the route to send back the beer list:

    app.get('/beers', function (req, res) {
      console.log('Received request for beers from', req.ip)
      res.json(beerList);
    });

## Getting beer details

Now we want to be able to serve the beer details using the `/beer/:beerId` route.
The easiest way would be to load the right JSON file at each request and send it back to the
client:

    app.get('/beer/:beerId', function (req, res) {
      console.log('Received request for '+req.param('beerId')+' from', req.ip)
      var beerDetails = require('./beers/'+req.param('beerId')+'.json');
      res.json(beerDetails);
    });
